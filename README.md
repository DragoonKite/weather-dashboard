The current data is displayed on the right of the screen with the following information: City name and cloud-cover icon, temperature, humidity wind speed, and UV index (color coded due to deverity). Below that is the 5-day forecast. Each day is a separate card with the following information: date, cloud-cover icon, temperature, humidity. Below the search box the user's search history is displayed and can be clicked on to redisplay the weather data.
